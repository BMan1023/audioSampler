Audio Sampler

Each of the three mp3 files has
a play and stop button corresponding 
to it. Clicking play starts playback, and
clicking stop ends playback.

There is a slider at the bottom of the
screen that is used to adjust the level
of distortion on each track. I tried to implement
a button to switch the distortion on and off.
This feature currently does not work.

If you click a button immediatly upon starting 
the program, it will error. I believe this is because
the files have not had time to load. Waiting 5 or so 
seconds seems to remedy this issue.

The slider bar is a little tricky as you have to move 
your mouse slowly so that it can keep up.
